# School_District_Analysis
module 4 

Discoveries made during analysis:
The overall public school budget is slightly higher than the overall charter school budget but the math scores for charter schools is higher for all grades except for grade 12.  The reading scores of public schools are higher than charter schools, except for grade 11.  Based on the analysis done for this project, there does not seem to be an obvious correlation between budget increases and higher test scores.        

Additional analysis that would be worthwhile:
It would be interesting to analyze the test scores of students, according to the size of the school they attend.  Evaluating this data might help us understand if smaller or larger schools are best for maximizing student test scores.
